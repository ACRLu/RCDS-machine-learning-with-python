# Machine Learning with Python

Getting started with scikit-learn for machine learning


Following on from the Introduction to Machine Learning course, this series of hands-on workshops will get you started with applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods in Python, using the popular `scikit-learn` package.

## Intended Learning Outcomes

After completing this workshop, you will be better able to:

* Prepare a dataset for machine learning in Python
* Select a scikit-learn method appropriate for a particular learning task
* Construct your own workflows for model training and testing
* Evaluate the performance of a model

## Getting set up

Please ensure that you have an up-to-date scikit-learn package installed prior to starting the first session.
General installation instructions are available here:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html#installation-instructions

scikit-learn is part of the default installation of Anaconda, so you may already have everything you need.

We will be working with Jupyter notebooks during the sessions using the JupyterLab platform - again this is provided within Anaconda.


## Data sets

We will be working with a variety of real and synthetic data sets to illustrate various methods.
For your own work between classes, it is recommended to identify a suitable data set from your own research or from other work in your field.
This will be discussed more during the first session.
